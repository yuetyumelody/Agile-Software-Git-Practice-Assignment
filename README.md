### Opinion article about the software problem in the Iowa caucus
*Link to article:* [Here][1]

### My opinion:
This article stood out to me due to the recent problems technology in politics has been facing. Due to this being an opinion piece, the author can come off a certain way, but it's hard to argue against what he is saying. His frustration is everyone's frustration, because at the very least, when software is being used for something as important as politics, we want the tech to be as perfect as possible. If we can't trust our politics with software, then we'll never be able to smoothly progress forward and incorporate the two(ex: electronic voting).  Additionally, I like that the article makes the situation easier to understand for all, because the author explains terms such as `bug` or `security through obscurity`. Sometimes, tech articles stop appealing to the masses due to the overuse of jargon that people aren't normally familiar with. 

At the end of the day, the article and general situation teaches us that no matter how good we may view ourselves as engineers, nothing beats well-established engineering practices.
